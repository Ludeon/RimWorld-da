  <ArmorRating_Sharp.description>Armor against sharp damage like bullets, knife stabs, explosions, and animal bites.\n\nThis is the percentage chance that an attack will be affected by the armor. Once the damage is affected, there is a 50% chance it will be deflected entirely, and a 50% chance it will be partially absorbed and converted into a half-damage blunt impact. Many attacks have armor penetration that will cancel part of this armor rating.</ArmorRating_Sharp.description>
